QAX provides functionalities to perform quality assurance on ocean mapping data.

Accepted data inputs are raw files (*.all and *.gsf at this stage) and bathymetric grids.
The output are warnings, errors, reports, maps and data that are designed to assist with decision making
and debugging data or setup issues.

The objectives are to improve data accuracy, capture potential problems at source
and reduce the overall human time to quality control data.
